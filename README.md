# Terrorism-Network-Analysis
This repository contains the research work for our dissertation on Social Network Analysis (SNA) of Al-Qaeda and its affiliates' terrorism attacks (2000â€“2024). The study explores the structural patterns of terrorist networks using advanced network metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient, shortest path analysis, and community detection. The dataset is derived from sources like RAND reports, GTD data, NCTC, and UN reports. The project includes Python code for network visualization, geospatial analysis, and predictive link modeling, contributing to a deeper understanding of terrorist network structures.
